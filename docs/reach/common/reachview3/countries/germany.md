## Rover Setup

### Coordinate System

Choose a coordinate system based on the `ETRS89` datum (such as `ETRS89 / UTM zone 31N`).

### Vertical Datum

!!! note ""
	At the moment, ReachView 3 doesn't support vertical datums for this country.

## Base Setup

Your base or NTRIP service should be in `ETRS89`.

When setting up a base station on a benchmark, enter `ETRS89` geographic coordinates (lat/long) and ellipsoidal height in the ReachView 3 *Settings / Base mode*.
