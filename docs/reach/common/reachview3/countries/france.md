## Rover Setup

### Coordinate System

Choose a coordinate system based on the `RGF93` datum (such as `RGF93 / CC42`).

### Vertical Datum

Choose the `NGF-IGN69 height` vertical datum.

The `RAF18` geoid is used to perform the transformation.

## Base Setup

Your base or NTRIP service should be in `RGF93`.

When setting up a base station on a benchmark, enter `RGF93` geographic coordinates (lat/long) and ellipsoidal height in the ReachView 3 *Settings / Base mode*.
