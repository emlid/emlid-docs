## Rover Setup

### Coordinate System

Choose a coordinate system based on the `SWEREF99` datum (such as `SWEREF99 / RT90`).

### Vertical Datum

Choose the `RH2000 height` vertical datum.

The `SWEN17_RH2000` geoid is used to perform the transformation.

## Base Setup

Your base or NTRIP service should be in `SWEREF99`.

!!! note ""
	The `SWEREF99` datum is a national realization of `ETRS89`.

When setting up a base station on a benchmark, enter `SWEREF99` geographic coordinates (lat/long) and ellipsoidal height in the ReachView 3 *Settings / Base mode*.
