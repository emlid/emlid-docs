## Rover Setup

### Coordinate System

Choose a coordinate system based on the `ETRS89` datum (such as `ETRS89 / GK27FIN`).

### Vertical Datum

Choose one of the available vertical datums:

* `N2000 height`
* `N60 height`

The following geoids are used to perform the transformation:

* `N2000`
* `N60`

## Base Setup

Your base or NTRIP service should be in `ETRS89`.

When setting up a base station on a benchmark, enter `ETRS89` geographic coordinates (lat/long) and ellipsoidal height in the ReachView 3 *Settings / Base mode*.
