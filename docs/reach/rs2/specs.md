**SIM card slot** 

Reach RS2 has a built-in 3.5G modem with 2G fallback and global coverage. To get the corrections from NTRIP, you can simply insert the GSM SIM card inside Reach RS2 and set it up by [following this guide](https://docs.emlid.com/reachrs2/connecting-to-the-internet/#video-guide).

**RS-232 port** 

Reach RS2 can be supplied with constant power over the bottom connector. It's useful when you want to set up RS2 as a permanent base or integrate it with a tractor for precise agriculture. You can also configure the receiver to turn on and off in sync with an external battery. This feature is available in [ReachView Settings](https://docs.emlid.com/reachrs2/common/reachview/settings/#bottom-connector-settings).

To establish RTK communication with third-party devices, you can connect external radio via RS-232 port.

You can enable the position output to other devices or third-party apps via RS-232 port. You just need to turn on [“Position output” in ReachView](https://docs.emlid.com/reachrs2/common/reachview/position-output/#serial).

**USB-C port**

Reach RS2 receiver can be charged via a USB-C cable connected to the power bank or USB adapter.

To establish RTK communication with third-party devices, you can connect external radio via USB-C port.

You can enable the position output to other devices or third-party apps via USB-C port. You just need to turn on [“Position output” in ReachView](https://docs.emlid.com/reachrs2/common/reachview/position-output/#serial).

**LoRa radio port** 

Reach RS2 has a built-in low-powered LoRa radio for RTK communication between Reach devices. Attach the LoRa antenna and [set up the LoRa link in ReachView](https://docs.emlid.com/reachrs2/common/quickstart/base-rover-setup/) to work on the baselines up to 8 km in the line of sight.
