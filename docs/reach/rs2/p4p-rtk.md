# DJI Phantom RTK and Reach RS2 base integration

This guide describes how to set Reach RS2 as a base for DJI Phantom 4 RTK drone. Such setup enables sending the corrections to the DJI RTK drone family during the flight and make real-time precise georeferencing of photos possible. 

DJI RTK drones are using the NTRIP to receive the corrections, that is why Reach RS2 could become a go-to solution as a base station in this setup. In order to make use of such setup, you will need:

- Reach RS2 acting as base
- DJI Phantom 4 RTK
- Internet access on both devices
- NTRIP credentials for RS2 base and DJI drone

You can get the NTRIP credentials from the Emlid NTRIP Caster.

## Accessing Emlid Caster

Emlid Caster is our free-to-use NTRIP caster. It allows transmitting corrections from your base to the rover. To get a personal mount point, you need to go through a login procedure:

- Go to the [caster.emlid.com](http://caster.emlid.com/). You will see a simple login screen:

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="../img/reachrs2/p4p/welcome_page.png" style="width: 600px;"/></p>

- Click the login link, and you will be prompted to log in or sign up. You can reuse your account from our community forum or create a new one:

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="../img/reachrs2/p4p/caster_login.png" style="width: 250px;"/></p>

- Once you log in, you will be issued a personal mount point. The interface will provide you with all the necessary credentials to enter in ReachView for both base and rover.

!!! note ""

	The mount point supports one simultaneous rover connection.

## Configuring Reach RS2

Reach RS2 acts as a base, sending the corrections via NTRIP service. 

- Place the Reach RS2 onto the tripod and provide it with the clear sky view
- Provide the receiver with an Internet access according to [this guide](../connecting-to-the-internet/)
- Navigate to the Base Mode tab and insert the NTRIP credentials for the base station

## Configuring DJI Phantom 4 RTK

- Open GS RTK
- Select Plan or Fly menu. If you choose Plan, select a planning method
- Open Settings by tapping on 3 dots button at the top right corner
- Go to RTK Settings tab
- In RTK Service Type, choose Custom network RTK and fill in NTRIP credentials form

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="../img/reachrs2/p4p/dji-correction-input.png" style="width: 600px;"/></p>

- Tap Connect button. The "Network RTK server connection successful" will appear:

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="../img/reachrs2/p4p/dji-correction-success.png" style="width: 600px;"/></p>

- Base is successfully connected

!!! note ""

	Phantom shows the base's satellites number only if the RTK solution status is fix.


## Performing the Flight

Once the RS2 and drone are set, you can perform your flight. Provide the Phantom 4 with a clear sky view and proceed to the mission:

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="../img/reachrs2/p4p/dji-flight.png" style="width: 600px;"/></p>

You can check the progress of your flight using the map on the bottom left corner of the UI:

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="../img/reachrs2/p4p/dji-plan.png" style="width: 600px;"/></p>

Once the flight is completed, you can download the precisely geotagged photos and use them to create your orthophotos.
