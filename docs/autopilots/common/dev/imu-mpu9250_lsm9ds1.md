## MPU9250 and LSM9DS1

Navio2 contains two 9DOF (degree of freedom) IMU - MPU9250 and LSM9DS1. Each of them combines a gyroscope, an accelerometer and a magnetometer in one device. IMU sensors are not only popular as a part of drone autopilot projects, but are also widely used in devices like cellphones, tablets, etc.

## IMU example

If you haven't already done that, download Navio2 drivers and examples code [here](navio-repository-cloning.md).

IMU example for Navio2 runs with one of the on-board sensors at a time. During start-up program you have to specify with which sensor to work.

### C++ 
Move to the folder with the source code, compile and run the example:

```bash
cd C++/Examples/AccelGyroMag
make
./AccelGyroMag -i [sensor name]
```

### Python  
Move to the folder with the source code, compile and run the example:
```bash
cd Python
python AccelGyroMag.py -i [sensor name]
```
Argument [sensor name] allows you to choose inertial measurement unit: mpu is MPU9250, lsm is LSM9DS1.

!!! tip ""
    LSM9DS1 driver is currently not implemented. Use the C++ counterpart

You should immediately see 9 values, updated in real time. Try to move the device around and see them change. They include Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer data, three axis each.

```  

For further information see source code. Function ```create_inertial_sensor()``` creates object of class MPU9250 or LSM9DS1 depending on the argument passed to the program.
The next thing we should pay attention to is the line ```sensor->initialize()```, as it does an important job of setting internal device parameter. Note that this function also sets scales for both Accelerometer and Gyroscope (and for Magnitometer in case of LSM9DS1).  
The main function loop is pretty straightforward: read the data, print the data.
