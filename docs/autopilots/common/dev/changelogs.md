- Raspberry PI 4 Model B support
- Fixed servo rail voltage
- Rootfs auto-expanding on a first boot

*2019-02-27*

- ArduPilot updated:
    - ArduRover: 3.4.2
    - ArduCopter: 3.6.5
    - ArduPlane: 3.9.5
    - ArduSub: 3.5.3

- kernel updated to v4.14.95
- Raspberry PI 3 Model A+ support
- emlidtool: 1.0.8
- added pigpio

*2018-05-25:*

- ArduPilot updated:
    - ArduRover: 3.3.0
    - ArduCopter: 3.5.5
    - ArduPlane: 3.8.5

- new packages for kernel and headers

    RPI's raspberrypi-kernel and raspberrypi-kernel-headers packages substitute with version for Navio. This allows to install packages dependent on raspberrypi* and libraspberrypi*.

- kernel updated to v4.14.34
- Raspberry PI 3 Model B+ support
- emlidtool: 1.0.6
- rcio-firmware: 1.5.4-1.2
- rcio-dkms: 1.0.0:
    - Virtual GPIO support
    - Support for kernels >= 4.10
- removed rpi-update package
- removed WBC support

*2017-03-23:*

- preinstalled ArduPilot with systemd scripts:
    - Arducopter: 3.4.6
    - ArduPlane: 3.7.1
    - APMrover2: 3.1.2
    - ardupilot.service: 0.9.0

- Wi-Fi broadcast support
- preinstalled ROS Indigo

    *ros-indigo-mavros* is held back to discourage updates: ROS Indigo depends on 0.17.x versions of mavros which doesn't handle properly some Boost error handling. Hence some monkey patching is needed.

- make Emlid distribution fully compliant with official Raspbian

    This means that all packages that depend on libraspberrypi0 and raspberrypi-bootloader will work as expected.
    For example ```sudo apt-get install python-picamera``` will work

- add python3, python3-pip, mavproxy, droneapi, tmux
- emlitool: 0.8.6
- fix rcio-dkms updates:

    rcio.dtbo could get not regenerated for newer kernels. The latter is now part of ```raspberrypi-kernel-emlid``` package.

- fixed /boot/wpa_supplicant.conf issue that made it dissapear after the first boot
- miscellaneous bugfixes

*2016-07-18:*

- Added driver for rtl8812-based Wi-Fi dongles
- Moved image snapshot closer to upstream
- Updated rcio-dkms to 0.6
