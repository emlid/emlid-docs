# Precise Point Positioning

With the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technique, you may accurately determine the coordinates of a static point anywhere in the world without real-time corrections or base station nearby.

!!! tip ""

    You can do PPP with both Reach RS2 and Reach RS+ devices. To process data from Reach RS+, use the NRCAN CSRS-PPP service. [More details are below.](#nrcan-csrs-ppp-service)

In this guide, we will walk you through the following steps:

- Recording RINEX data on Reach
- Exporting raw data from ReachView to your mobile device or PC
- Uploading the collected file to PPP service (OPUS or NRCAN)
- Entering the obtained base coordinates into ReachView

The equipment you need to accomplish the survey:

- Reach receiver
- Tripod

## How PPP works

A standalone receiver finds out its position relying on the data obtained from satellites only. Along with raw data, it also gets navigation messages containing such data as satellite clock offset, the ionospheric and tropospheric corrections, etc. Due to information about these offsets, the receiver may calculate its position with a few meters' accuracy. If there was no navigation data, the accuracy would be much worst.

In RTK and PPK, these offsets might be eliminated since both the base and the rover operate in quite similar conditions.

PPP allows the single receiver to achieve high-level accuracy without the use of corrections from the base station. To calculate the coordinates, PPP uses the same data that are provided by the navigation message but much more accurate. Thereby, the Single receiver might determine its position with a centimeter-level accuracy using only its own raw data and precise ephemerides and clock offsets provided by a PPP service.


The PPP technique is commonly used for determining the absolute base position for further RTK/PPK surveys.

### Advantages and disadvantages of using PPP

Post-Processed PPP has both advantages and disadvantages in comparison with [PPK technology:](../../common/tutorials/ppk-introduction.md)

<center>

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :----------: | :-------------: |
| Only one receiver is needed| The time required to move from Float to a fixed solution |
| The position can be highly accurate determined at any place on the Earth | Most PPP services only allow using Static processing currently | 
| The position is determined with absolute accuracy | Most PPP services only allow GPS processing currently |
|  | Most PPP services only allow multi-frequency processing |

## PPP services overview

There are several PPP services available. In this guide, we will take a closer look at the [US NOAA's OPUS PPP service](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS/) and the [Canadian NRCAN CSRS-PPP service.](https://webapp.geod.nrcan.gc.ca/geod/tools-outils/ppp.php)

!!! danger ""

    AUSPOS, a PPP service widely used in the Asia-Pacific region, doesn't currently support L2C observations from Reach. The L2C support should be added in the future.

### NOAA's OPUS PPP service

Online Positioning User Service (OPUS) is provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

OPUS PPP service uses dual-frequency GPS data for solution computation and supports the Static mode only. The Static data is required to be recorded on the stationary unmoving receiver.

There are 2 ways you can process the data in OPUS:

- Static (for data that are 2 to 48 hours in duration)
- Rapid-Static (for data that are 15 minutes to 2 hours in duration)

The Static and Rapid-Static methods use different processing software and provide pretty similar horizontal accuracy. The Rapid-Static processing has more strict requirements for the data quality in comparison with the Static approach. Moreover, Rapid-Static processing is available only for some regions. <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

!!! note ""

    In this guide, we will show you how to process raw data from Reach RS2 using the Static method.

You can learn more about NOAA's OPUS PPP service on their [official site.](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS/about.jsp)

### NRCAN CSRS-PPP service

The Canadian Spatial Reference System (CSRS) PPP service is provided by Natural Resources Canada's Canadian Geodetic Survey.

NRCAN CSRS-PPP service uses single or dual-frequency GPS and GLONASS data for solution computation and supports both Static and Kinematic modes.

- **Static** computation is accomplished with a receiver sitting on one point. In the result of Static mode, you will get the absolutely determined position of this point
- **Kinematic** mode allows surveying with a moving receiver and provides a path as the solution

Depending on the accuracy level and time that is required to get the solution, NRCAN CSRS-PPP service can calculate the data in the following modes <sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>
:

- **FINAL:** the accuracy is about 2 cm, available 13 -15 days after the end of the week
- **RAPID:** the accuracy is about 5 cm, available the next day
- **ULTRA RAPID:** the accuracy is about 15 cm, available every 90 minutes

!!! note ""

    In this guide, we will show you how to process raw data from Reach RS2 recorded in the Static mode. However, with the NRCAN CSRS tool, it is also possible to process the data from a single-band Reach RS/RS+ receiver. With Reach RS/RS+, you will get an accuracy of about 30 cm.

You can learn more about NRCAN CSRS-PPP service on their [official site.](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/maps-tools-publications/tools/geodetic-reference-systems-tools/tools-applications/10925#ppp)

## Results assessment

After you get the solution report, it might be useful to check how accurate the results are.

### NOAA's OPUS PPP

In the solution report, you will get the name of the used reference frame, the XYZ and LLH coordinates of the point and accuracy estimation in meters. Additionally, you can check these fields: OBS USED, FIXED AMB, OVERALL RMS. 

The most accurate OPUS solutions have the following characteristics:

- Over 90% of observations are used
- Over 50% of ambiguities are fixed
- Overall RMS is less than 3 cm

### NRCAN CSRS-PPP

In the solution report, look for the Estimated Position for raw_*.obs header.

There should be a table with 4 rows:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/ppp-introduction/table.png" style="width: 600px;"></div>

- The first row contains calculated LLH coordinates in chosen coordinate system
- The Sigmas row shows an estimated accuracy
- In the A Priori row, there is an averaged in Single mode position taken from the RINEX header
- The Estimated - A Priori row displays the accuracy from this position specified in the RINEX header

## Setting up obtained base coordinates in ReachView

If you need the acquired coordinates to use them as the base position for RTK/PPK, you can now enter the base coordinated into ReachView.

- In ReachView, go to *Base mode* tab
- In the Base coordinates input mode, choose Manual
- Set up the required data format (LLH or XYZ)
- Enter the coordinates and specify the antenna height

!!! note ""

    You may need to convert the solution you get to WGS84.
