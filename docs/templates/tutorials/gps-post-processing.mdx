## Required data

This tutorial requires:

* Raw logs from the rover
* Raw logs from the base
* (Optional) For absolute positioning: RINEX observations log from a reference station in range of 100 km (60 miles) for RS2 and 30 km (18 miles) for RS+
* (Optional) For processing improvement: precise ephemeris and clock files from the IGS
* RTKLIB

Rover track is calculated relatively to the base station so in order to get rover track with correct absolute coordinates the exact position of the base station should be known. You either need to place base station on a point with known coordinate or determine it by post-processing base against a reference station in static mode.

It is better if the station is in the range of 100 km (60 miles) for RS2 and 30 km (18 miles) for RS+, but longer range might work as well.


## Converting raw logs to RINEX (if needed)

!!! note ""
    If your raw logs from base and rover are saved in .ubx format you should convert them to RINEX. If you already have RINEX logs from the receivers you can skip this step.

Start RTKLIB RTKCONV after downloading raw files from Reach to your PC.

* Add your rover raw log in the first field and choose output directory
* Choose format of your log in pop-down menu. Set format to _u-blox_ if logs were downloaded from each device. Otherwise, choose RTCM3 if base and rover logs were received from rover

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkconv_format.png" style="width: 400px;"></div>

* Push _Options_ button
* Choose RINEX Version 3.03
* Turn on Satellites Systems you need

{%if model == 'RS2' or model == 'M2'%}
* Enable L1, L2 and L7 frequencies in the _Frequencies_ panel
{%else%}

* Enable L1 frequency in the Frequencies tab
{%endif%}

!!! note ""

    The table below shows the correspondence between the RINEX frequencies shown in the RTKPlot and the GNSS signal frequencies. This information is valid for RINEX 2.11 and RINEX 3.03.

    |      QZSS      |      L1      |             |

    </center>

* Press _OK_ and _Convert_ after

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkconv_options.png" style="width: 400px;"></div>

Now you should repeat the same with base log. Don't forget to change format.
After that you'll see something similar in your output folder.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkconv_output_folder.png" style="width: 600px;"></div>


### Calculating base position

Start RTKLIB RTKPOST software and enter the fields as shown here. If running for the first time you will need to set mode to Kinematic or Static in the options to unlock the fields for base station data. You can skip the start time, it is not compulsory.

* Choose rover .obs file for the _Rover_ field (RINEX file from your rover)
* Select base station .obs file for the _Base Station_ field (RINEX file from your base)
* Put base or rover .nav file in the third field
* (Optional) You can as well add precise ephemeris and clocks at this stage. They are required for long baselines

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkpost_adding_files.png" style="width: 400px;"></div>


* Now proceed to the options by pushing _Options_ button.
* Set positioning mode you need. Usually, it's _Kinematic_ or _Static_.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkpost_setting1_mode.png" style="width: 400px;"></div>


* Choose _Elevation Mask_ value. Usually it's 15-20
* Push _SNR Mask_ button and set the value you need. This will help you to avoid satellites with low signal strength

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkpost_setting1_mask.png" style="width: 400px;"></div>


* Turn on _Rec Dynamics_ to estimate receiver velocity and acceleration. Use it for DGPS/DGNSS or Kinematic modes.
* Select used navigation systems.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkpost_setting1_dynamics.png" style="width: 400px;"></div>


* Go to the _Setting2_ tab
* Set _Integer Ambiguity Res_ to _Fix and Hold_. In this mode continuously static integer ambiguities are estimated and resolved. If the validation's OK, the ambiguities are tightly constrained to the resolved values

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkpost_setting2_ambiguity.png" style="width: 400px;"></div>


* Turn on _AR Filtering_

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkpost_setting2_ar.png" style="width: 400px;"></div>


* Switch to _Positions_ tab
* Select _Base Station_. Choose _Average of Single Position_ for any log to average single point solution or _RINEX Header Position_ to use approximate position in RINEX .obs header

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkpost_positions_base.png" style="width: 400px;"></div>


* Press _OK_ button and _Execute_ in the main window
* You'll see green process bar. Wait until _Done_ label. It could take quite a lot of time if your logs are big

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkpost_execute.png" style="width: 400px;"></div>


After that you'll see something similar in your output folder. The .pos file with "__event" will contain timestamps if you had them during your job.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkpost_output_folder.png" style="width: 600px;"></div>

## Result visualization and analysis

Open RTKLIB RTKPLOT and drag and drop your .pos file.
If you see green points that mean that they're fix (Q=1), orange mean float (Q=2), red - single (Q=5).

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkplot_pos.png" style="width: 600px;"></div>


After that you could add .obs file to see more analyzing tools in pop-down menu.
For example, first image shows _Satellite Visibility_ and second one _Position_ in 3 directions.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkplot_satvis.png" style="width: 600px;"></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkplot_position.png" style="width: 600px;"></div>

If you've got time marks add them as a second solution _(File > Open Solution-2)_.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/reach/post-processing/rtkplot_timemarks.png" style="width: 600px;"></div>


Looks really good, isn't it?
