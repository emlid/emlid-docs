### Connecting to Reach {{model}}

!!! tip "Using Reach with Android device"
    Turn off the mobile data on your device before connecting to Reach's hotspot.

* Open a list of Wi-Fi networks on your smartphone/PC

* Connect to a network named **reach:xx:xx**

* Type network password: **emlidreach**


### Setting up Wi-Fi

??? note "Using Reach with iOS/Android device"

    1. Get the ReachView app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reachview) or [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reachview/id1295196887?mt=8)
    2. Open the app and choose Reach from the list
    4. Tap the *plus* button and enter your Wi-Fi network name, security type, and password
    5. Tap *Save* button
    6. Tap on the added network and then *Connect*

??? note "Using Reach with a web browser from any device"

    1. Launch a web browser (we recommend using Chrome or Mozilla)
    2. Go to 192.168.42.1
    3. Tap the *plus* button and enter your Wi-Fi network name, security type, and password
    
        !!! tip "Windows OS"
                Windows may ask you to enter the PIN from the router label to connect to the network. Choose **Connect 
                using a security key instead** option.
                
    4. Tap *Save* button
    5. Tap on the added network and then *Connect*

Reach {{model}} will stop broadcasting Wi-Fi and connect to your network. 

{%if model == "RS/RS+"%}
The Network LED will blink rapidly while scanning for networks. Once Reach connects to Wi-Fi, the LED will start blinking slowly.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/quickstart/first-setup/{{model_path}}/running-client.png" style="width: 200px;"></div>
{%endif%}

!!! note ""
    If your device did not connect to a Wi-Fi network, it will switch back to a hotspot mode.
    In that case, repeat the steps and double check your network name and password. 


### Accessing Reach {{model}} device in a network

!!! danger ""
    Make sure that your smartphone/PC has connected to the same Wi-Fi network as Reach.

??? note "Using Reach with iOS/Android device"

    1. Open ReachView app
    2. Refresh the list of devices
    3. Tap **reach**


??? note "Using Reach with PC"

    After connecting the Reach device to an existing Wi-Fi network, you will need to identify its IP.

    For this you can use:

    * "**Fing**" app for [iOS](https://goo.gl/Ho0qB) or [Android](https://goo.gl/7Wuwu)

    * ["**Nmap**"](https://nmap.org/) on Linux/OS X

    * ["**Zenmap**"](https://nmap.org/zenmap/) on Windows

    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../img/quickstart/first-setup/common/fing.png" style="width: 500px;"></div>

    * Reach will show up as "**Murata Manufacturing**" or "**AMPAK Technology**" device in these apps

    * Put Reach IP in the address bar and go

!!! danger "Reach can't work on the 192.168.2.xx subnet"

    As 192.168.2.x subnet is reserved inside Reach for Ethernet connections, you will need to perform initial setup in a different Wi-Fi or change router settings. Routers usually have a setting to change the subnet address, so you can set it to 192.168.1.xx

### Updating ReachView

After connecting to Reach {{model}}, you will see ReachView Updater again. Wait until it checks for the latest updates.

* If there is an update, press *Update ReachView* button and wait. This process will take a few minutes

* When it is done tap *Reboot and go to the app* button to reboot Reach {{model}}

* Wait for the blue LED to stop blinking, showing that Reach RS2 has joined your Wi-Fi network again

* If you use ReachView app, swipe right to get back to the list of devices, refresh the list and tap **reach**. As for the web browser, just refresh the page with ReachView. You will see the filling Emlid logo indicating the loading process of ReachView

Your Reach {{model}} is ready for work. Do the same with all other units.

[Now you can set up Base and Rover connection by following instruction from our guide.](base-rover-setup.md)
