You can place your smartphone near the window in your house and it will obtain GNSS coordinates after some time, but for RTK such environment won't be sufficient. For RTK to work there are special requirements for Reach placement.

### Clear sky view without any obstacles

{%if model == 'RS/RS+'%} 

Reach {{model}} needs to have a clear sky view 30 degrees above the horizon. There should be no obstacles that could block the view like buildings, trees, cars, humans, laptops, etc.

Take a look at 2 pictures below. The left picture demonstrates desirable conditions for Reach {{model}} location. The right one is an example of bad surrounding conditions such as the reduced view of the sky, possible obstructions or vegetation nearby.

### No electronics nearby

{%if model == 'RS/RS+'%} 

Electronic devices may produce RF noise that could affect the reception of the GNSS signal. Keep all electronics as far as possible from Reach {{model}}.
