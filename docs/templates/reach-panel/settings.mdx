## Reach Panel updates

### App version  
Every time you power up Reach {{ model }} in a Wi-Fi network, it checks for the new Reach Panel update and notifies you accordingly.

!!! note ""
    The update check is only done one time during the boot process. If you want to force new version check, please proceed to Reach Panel Updater. It is available on port 5000, for example, `http://reach.local:5000`. The Updater automatically scans Emlid update servers when you open it. [Learn more about Reach Panel updater.](updater.md)

## General settings

### Reach and hotspot name

Reach {{ model }} name can be changed in order to distinguish between multiple devices. A very common pattern is to name devices according to their base or rover function. A device name is a base for hotspot name and local network name. The default name is **reach**, changing it will also affect local name `http://reach.local` and hotspot name `reach:XX:XX`.

### Raw data debug
The raw data log can be supplemented by additional data for debugging purposes. This option turns off after rebooting the device. 

{% if model == "RS2" %}

### Public access

<p style="text-align:center" ><img src="../img/reach-panel/settings/public-access.png" style="width: 800px;" /></p>

Reach Panel offers Public access feature. This feature is available only if you use a SIM card with a static IP assigned by your cellular network operator. It allows access from outside local network.

!!! note ""
    It is recommended to use Public access only when it is necessary. This setting disables the firewall and makes Reach Panel available to anyone. 

{% endif %}

### Logging settings
Specify how Reach Panel will handle full memory behavior here, it can either stop logging or override old logs in favour of new ones. In most cases “rolling logs” is recommended.

### Log split period
A new log file will be created every N hours while preserving the previous log as well. This setting allows you to control the size of the files that you work with.
