To add a Wi-Fi network click on the blue plus sign, enter your Wi-Fi credentials and click create. 

To switch to hotspot mode click on “start hotspot” button.

During power up Reach will search for known Wi-Fi networks and if it does not see any create a hotspot. 

!!! Tip
    If you want to make Reach create hotspot every time, you should delete all Wi-Fi networks from the list. It is not possible to delete the network that you are currently connected to, so you will  need to switch Reach to hotspot mode. After switching to hotspot and connecting to it you will be able to delete all Wi-Fi networks and Reach will always start in hotspot mode.
