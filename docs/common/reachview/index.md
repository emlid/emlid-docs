## About 

ReachView is a web-based app that allows you to take full control of Reach RTK module and Reach RS/RS+/RS+. It is the most user friendly app ever created for an RTK system and apart from numerous features has OTA updates that ensure that you constantly work with up-to-date version of the app. It works on any device with a browser and does not require internet connection. ReachView is hosted on the Reach itself and is accessed via Wi-Fi connection, which makes it compatible with Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and iOS.

## Resolving IP

ReachView app is served via a browser or a native app for iOS/Android. In order to access Reach device one needs to find the IP address of the Reach in the network. Depending on the operating system and ReachView app version on board of Reach or Reach RS/RS+ this might be done in different ways.

#### Windows
Access ReachView by typing “http://reach.local” in your browser. If you have changed name of the device, please type “http://device_name.local”. If the name could not be resolved:

- Find the IP address using ["Zenmap"](https://nmap.org/zenmap/).

#### OSX/Linux
Access ReachView by typing “http://reach.local” in your browser. If you have changed name of the device, please type “http://device_name.local”. If the name could not be resolved:

- Find the IP address using [“nmap”](https://nmap.org/).

#### iOS

- Find the IP address using “Fing” app.

#### Android  
Android does not support name resolution in local network. You will need to find the IP address:

- Find the IP address using “Fing” app.
- Use “Network Tools” app, it is also able to find Reach IP address when it is connected to your smartphone hotspot.

### When your device is connected to Reach Hotspot

By default Reach creates a Wi-Fi hotspot and you can connect to it as to any other Wi-Fi network. Beware that sometimes your mobile phone will attempt to automatically switch to 3G/4G connections as Wi-Fi hotspot created by Reach does not provide internet access.

+ When prompted if you want to stay connected to the network without Internet connection answer “yes”.
+ If your smartphone is still on 3G/4G connection and there is “?” mark near the Wi-Fi icon you might want to temporary disable mobile data. That will force your smartphone to connect to the Wi-Fi network.

**Access ReachView by typing “http://reach.local” or 192.168.42.1 in your browser on any OS.**

!!! danger "Reach can't work on the 192.168.2.xx subnet "
    As 192.168.2.x subnet is reserved inside Reach for Ethernet connections, you will need to perform initial setup in a different Wi-Fi or change router settings. Routers usually have a setting to change the subnet address, so you can set it to 192.168.1.xx.

## First setup

### Connecting to Reach

+ Open a list of Wi-Fi networks on your smartphone, tablet or laptop.

+ Type network password: emlidreach.

### Setting up Wi-Fi

After connecting to the network hosted by reach, open a web browser on your smartphone, tablet or laptop. 

Type http://192.168.42.1 in the address bar and you will see ReachView Updater.
